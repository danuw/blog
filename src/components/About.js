        About me?
    </h1>
    <p>
      If you are reading this, I finally did it! I finally managed to get that blog out after all these years of dilly-dallying around what platform to use, what name to use or what the content could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I needed a blog that would help motivate me to push some of my personnal projects to completion - giving me one additional possible incentive to do more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, hope that some of the content in here will be of interest to other people too.
